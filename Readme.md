# Introduction

This is an experimental project in which I don't want to use any build agents which are out there such as webpack, rollup etc.

Also I don't really like that virtual dom the number of checks the frameworks such as React , Vue and Angular has to perform just to figure out 
what area has been changed. There is a lot which is hidden from the developer.

My goals for this are:

- How to use what is provided by browser.
- How to still use ES6 features.
- Avoid Virtual dom.
- Provide a simple Reactive model which will be able to react whenever there is a change.

If you are interested in this project feel free to contact me and we can share ideas. I am a big fan of social coding!
